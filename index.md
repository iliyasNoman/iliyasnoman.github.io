      I am a college student with a strong background in competitive math and foundational AI concepts. My recent work focuses on understanding machine learning systems, including topics like contrastive learning, representation learning, and white-box auditing of unlearning in models.

      Beyond research, I enjoy diving into interesting problems, exploring deep learning papers, experimenting with PyTorch and tensors, and staying active through climbing and soccer.
