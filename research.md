**Venue:** NeurIPS 2025 (39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)  
**Abstract:** The meta‑task of obtaining and aligning representations through contrastive pretraining is steadily gaining importance since its introduction in CLIP and ALIGN. In this paper we theoretically explain the advantages of synchronizing with trainable inverse temperature and bias under the sigmoid loss, as implemented in the recent SigLIP and SigLIP2 models. Temperature and bias can drive the loss function to zero for a rich class of configurations that we call \((m, b_{\mathrm{rel}})\)-Constellations. These are novel combinatorial objects related to spherical codes, parametrized by a margin \(m\) and relative bias \(b_{\mathrm{rel}}\). We use our characterization to justify the success of SigLIP on retrieval, to explain the modality gap present in SigLIP, and to identify the necessary dimension for producing high‑quality representations. Finally, we propose a re‑parameterization of the sigmoid loss with explicit relative bias, which improves training dynamics in experiments with synthetic data.

### Spectral Conditions for Spherical Two‑Distance Sets  
**Authors (alphabetical):** Iliyas Noman, Yuan Yao  
**Venue:** Discrete Mathematics, 2025 (published)  
**Abstract:** A set of points \(S\) in \(d\)-dimensional Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is called a 2‑distance set if the set of pairwise distances between the points has cardinality two. The 2‑distance set is called spherical if its points lie on the unit sphere in \(\mathbb{R}^d\). We characterize spherical 2‑distance sets using the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of an associated graph and the spectrum of the projection of the adjacency matrix onto the orthogonal complement of the all‑ones vector. We also determine the lowest dimensional space in which a given spherical 2‑distance set could be represented using the graph spectrum.
